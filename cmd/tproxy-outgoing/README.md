# Tutorial

This tutorial shows how to use Envoy in [Transparent Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v2/api/v2/lds.proto#envoy-api-field-listener-transparent) mode. The distinguishing feature in this scenario is that there is no NAT.

Transparent Proxy or TPROXY is a Linux Kernel feature without a lot of documentation. The common referenced documentation is the [original feature write-up](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/tproxy.txt)

This was tested on **AWS** Ubuntu 18.04


## 1. Network Diagram

 
![You need to see the network diagram][./img/envoy_network.png]


## 2. Router

The router host performs the following functions:

* Forwards packets between client and server
* Runs Envoy Proxy
* Transparently redirect packets to Envoy Proxy


### 2.1 Forwarding

Enable forwarding on the host. There are many good tutorials on the web on how to enable forwarding on a Linux host. 

### 2.2 Envoy Docker

Build and run Envoy Docker

```
./build_ubuntu_docker.sh
./build_envoy_docker_net_admin.sh
```

Envoy docker needs to run with **--network host** and **--cap-add=NET_ADMIN** because it needs access to the original destination IP:port of the packet. This is done by using the socket option **SO_ORIGINAL_DST**. Check Envoy's specific documentation on [original destination filter](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/listener_filters/original_dst_filter)

Finally, the Envoy container **must** be run under root in order for the IPTables redirection to work properly as we will see later. You should see an output similar to this one.

```
ubuntu$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
2cdeadaf09d1        envoy-tproxy        "/bin/sh -c ./start_â€¦"   10 hours ago        Up 10 hours                             envoy-tproxy
ubuntu$ ps aux | grep envoy
root      4185  0.0  0.0   4628   812 ?        Ss   Aug17   0:00 /bin/sh -c ./start_envoy.sh
root      4214  0.0  0.0   4628   796 ?        S    Aug17   0:00 /bin/sh ./start_envoy.sh
root      4215  0.1  0.6 129688 24380 ?        Sl   Aug17   0:42 envoy -c /etc/service-envoy.yaml --log-level debug
ubuntu    5802  0.0  0.0  14660  1148 pts/0    S+   09:32   0:00 grep --color=auto envoy
```


#### 2.2.1 Socket Option SO_ORIGINAL_DST

A small [python script](./original_destination.py) is included to demonstrate how proxies get the original IP:port from redirected connections. Assuming the IPTables rule below is in place, start this script as root instead of Envoy to get a deeper understanding of this socket option.

### 2.3 TPROXY

Installing TPROXY kernel module is tricky and there are many unanswered question from people on the net. If it *just works* when you try consider yourself lucky. Again, this tutorial was tested on AWS Ubuntu 18.04

I created this simple step-by-step script to help install TPROXY. If you get errors  just open the file ans execute each command in order.

```
./tproxy_install.sh
```

### 2.4 IPTables, Route and Rule

In order for transparent proxy to work a set of IPTables rules, routes and rules need to be created. 

```
./create_ip_tables.sh
```

## 3. Web Server

The Web Server for this example was running on *172.31.24.143*

I normally use [httpbin](http://httpbin.org/) as the Web Server. A reliable, no-hassle, perfect-for-testing web server.

```
./run_web_docker.sh
```

## 4. Client Host

### 4.1 Route

Add a route to the web server through the router host.

```
ubuntu$ sudo ip route show

...snip...

172.31.24.143 via 172.31.20.57 dev eth0
```

### 4.2 HTTP Request

Use cURL or your preferred HTTP client to perform a request to the web server. 

```
ubuntu$ curl -v 172.31.24.143
* Rebuilt URL to: 172.31.24.143/
*   Trying 172.31.24.143...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to 172.31.24.143 (172.31.24.143) port 80 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: 172.31.24.143
> User-Agent: curl/7.58.0

```
